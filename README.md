## Overview

![cmvgif](img/1.gif)

We created a website for students to choose campus based on the states' overall campus crime rates. With vivid data visualization, hopefully, our website would be a guidance for the students.

## Code and Data

Code: index.html is our website's page, also we used states.json to draw the U.S. Map.

Library: All our data is in Data folder, crimeDevidedByStates.csv, dataset.csv, schoolType.csv, and sum.csv provide all the data we drew the charts. Also, we used fullpage.js to realize the scrolling effect.

## Non-obvious Features of Our Interface

**U.S. Campus Crime Distribution**

We provide states' crime data in several interactive charts. All of them are connected, you would see the specific states' detailed data.

We also provide a filter to choose schools in a specific state. By choosing the viewers preferences, you would see the top 5 safest schools in the state.
